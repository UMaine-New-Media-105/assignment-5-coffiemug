draw 5 vibrating bubbles using a class and objects. 


A5Q2
https://editor.p5js.org/coffiemug/sketches/dioDEd7cQ
using the class you created, draw 50 bubbles from an array with a for() loop, and use another for() loop to draw the array in the draw function. they bounce off the walls instead of jittering in place now. I also randomized the starting x and y positions, the size (r, for radius), and both the vertical and horizontal speed.
