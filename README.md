draw 5 vibrating bubbles using a class and objects.

using the class you created, draw 50 bubbles from an array with a for() loop, and use another for() loop to draw the array in the draw function. they bounce off the walls instead of jittering in place now. I also randomized the starting x and y positions, the size (r, for radius), and both the vertical and horizontal speed.

create the particles, breeders, and catchers for your sim game! I created this tulip field as my particles, bubbles as my breeders— which are already moving and colliding properly with the canvas boundaries although they do not breed yet— and butterflies as my catchers, which also move properly and will eventually pop the bubbles upon collision.
this is a pretty nonsensical concept for this idea but I wanted to do something fun :) I plan to make the bubbles multiply when they hit the canvas walls as well, as the bubbles touching each other and multiplying that way makes even less sense. but there will still be collision detectiono between sprites in the final sim as the butterflies will pop the bubbles.

activate the bubbles so that a new bubble is created when they bounce back to the left.

activate butterflies so they pop the bubbles upon collision. also added a wingflap animation in place of the random jitter for the bbutterflies, and made them bounce morre smoothly off the top and bottom edges by distinguishing between flySpeedX and flySpeedY. tweaked bubble numbers and made new ones spawn on both sides of the canvas. really happy with and proud of this assignment :) great way to wind up the class, thank you both Jon and VJ for a wonderful semester!
